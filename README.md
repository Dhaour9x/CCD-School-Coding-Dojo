# CCD-School-Coding-Dojo
Clean software development needs to be practised. For this, practice tasks are needed. 
In the Coding Dojo, the Clean Code Developer School collects such tasks under the established name "Kata". 
The katas have different scopes to offer something for every taste, level and time budget.
